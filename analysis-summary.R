# analysis plan 

# for each NARS assessment wetland
# table of condition statuses, ecoregion, and wetland type

# find closet assessed water(s)


# for assessed waters close to NARS sites
# find distance to nars site
# find impairment status and year of listing
# find impairment cause(s)
# find impairment source(s) 
# find designated use

# compare wetland condition and impairment status
# by ecoregion, wetland type, other major covariates

# compare similarity of condition across distances
# within and not within same catchment/downstream

# do wetland (and stream?) buffer characteristics modulate similarity?
